Webserver log Parser


## Dependancies

- install gauge ( brew install gauge)
- ruby 2.6.3

## To run tests

gauge run

this will create a html report which can be found in

reports/html-report/index.html showing the results.

## How it works

to call the parser please call bundle exec .bin/parser <file_name>

## Things I would improve

- I would use regeular exppressions to extract the data from the lines in the webserver log.
  I would then fail if the row does not conform

- I would implement a streaming solution,so that you dont have to read the whole file in one go.
